**Brewward: Collect, Trade, and Sip**  
Built with ❤️ by **Team JEDI**

## 🚀 Overview

**Coffee Quest** transforms traditional loyalty programs into a fun, social, and gamified experience. Instead of boring point systems, users collect unique coffee ingredients, trade with others, and redeem rewards — all while sipping their favourite brew!

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> People love rewards, but most loyalty systems are boring and passive.  
> We wanted something **social**, **fun**, and **game-like** — and since **coffee is love, coffee is life**, we built around it!

## 🛠️ What We Built

- A web application where users can:
  - 🧩 **Collect** unique coffee ingredients
  - 🔄 **Trade** with other users
  - 🎁 **Redeem** a coupon for a real cup of coffee
- Built to be:
  - 🌐 Social & Interactive
  - 🕹️ Fun & Competitive
  - 🎯 Reward-driven

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Users engage with the app and earn collectable ingredients.
2. Ingredients can be traded with other users to complete recipes.
3. Completing a recipe allows the user to redeem a real-world coffee reward.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **DevOps**: Docker

## 🧾 Conclusion

We reimagined loyalty systems by adding excitement and interactivity. Leveraging modern technologies, we turned simple rewards into a social game—all fueled by coffee.
